# 6.172 Performance Engineering of Software Systems( from MIT OCW)
Introduction to building scalable and high-performance software systems. Topics
include performance analysis, algorithmic techniques for high performance,
instruction-level optimizations, caching optimizations, parallel programming,
and building scalable systems.
# Project 2: Collision Detection
Optimized collision detector. Computes the number of line-wall and line-line
collisions that occur during a certain number of frames in a screensaver.
# Compiling and running
Compile with make and run with ./screensaver [-g] <numFrames> [input-file]. The -g flag shows graphics over X11.
